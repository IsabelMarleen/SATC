# SATC
Sex assignment through coverage

Framework for joint determination of individual sex and sex-linked scaffolds for non-model organism based on genome coverage. Our method assign individual sex by projecting sequencing depth of the samples to a two dimensional Principal Component Analysis plot followed by Gaussian mixture clustering. Jointly sex-linked scaffolds are identified based on differences in male and female read depth by a two-sample t-test.

SATC works following these steps:

1. Normalizing the depth of each scaffold within each sample
2. Reducing the dimensionality of the normalized depths using PCA
3. Clustering the samples using Gaussian mixtures clustering on the top PCs, 
4. Identifying the sample sex and sex-linked scaffolds from the clustering and the DoC. 


## Get SATC
```bash
git clone https://github.com/popgenDK/SATC
cd SATC/
```

### Install dependencies
The required R package (mclust) can be easily installed, we have already included an automatic install code in our main function if needed.

## Usage

SATC is run by executing the main function file satc.R:
```bash
Rscript --vanilla satc.R -i <idxfiles list> -o <prefix for output files>
```

All arguments and options are:
```
	Required arguments:


		-i --input:  Path to file with paths to idxstat files

		-o --output:  Prefix for output files


	Optional arguments:


		--weight:  Use weighted pca (default TRUE)

		--K:  Number of principal components used for clustering (default 2)

		--model:  Use gaussian clustering "gaussian" or hierarchical clustering "hclust" (default "gaussian")

		--minLength:  Minimum length of scaffolds to include, in bp (default 1e5)

		--M:  Number of scaffolds used for normalization (default 5)

		--normScaffolds:  Path to file with list of scaffolds to use for normalization; overwrites M (defualt NULL)

		--useMedian:  Use median depth of coverage of selected scaffolds for normalization instead of mean (default FALSE)

		-h:  Print help and exit
```

SATC will output three text files: a list of the inferred sex for each sample, a list with all sex linked scaffolds and another list with all sex linked scaffolds with depth difference consistent with being XZ chrosomome. It also produces two plots, and an R data object in (.rds) format conaining an R list with the data produced by SATC. To read the .rds file in R and extract the data and plots:
```R
data <-readRDS(file ="path to <prefix>.sexSample_sexScaffolds.rds") #reads SATC output
sexSamples <- data$sex #inferred sex for samples
X_Z_scaffolds <- data$SexScaffolds[data$SexScaffold$X_Z_Scaffolds,1] #get a vector of X_Z_scaffolds
Sex_linked_Scaffolds <- data$SexScaffolds[data$SexScaffold$Sex_linked_Scaffolds,1] #get a vector of Sex_linked_Scaffolds

#Plotting
source("satcFun.R")
#To get plot of normalized depth from all scaffolds and all samples
plotDepth(data)
#To get a PCA plot, different color suggest different sex
plotGroup(data)
#To get boxplots of X_Z Scaffolds grouped by sex
plotScafs(data)
#To get boxplots of Sex-linked Scaffolds grouped by sex
plotScafs(data,ab=T)
```

SATC can also run fully in R. 

```
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/popgenDK/SATC/main/satcFunc.R")

IDXFILE <- "path to your idxfile"
filenames <- scan(IDXFILE,what="sUp")
idx <- lapply(filenames,read.table,as.is=T)
filt <- filterScaffold(idx)
sex<-sexDetermine(filt)
plotGroup(sex)
plotScafs(sex)
```

## Example Usage

Below is an example of performing SATC on our leopard data:
```bash
Rscript --vanilla satc.R -i examples/leo_idxstats_path.txt -o leo
```

```R
data <-readRDS(file ="leo.sexSample_sexScaffolds.rds")

#Plotting
source("satcFun.R")
plotDepth(data)
plotGroup(data)
plotScafs(data)
```
By running SATC, it will automatically produced two plots (normalized depth plot, PCA and Sex-linked Scaffolds) in png format.

For example, here's a normalized depth plot of leopard dataset:

</p>

Also PCA plot and boxplot of Sex-linked Scaffolds:
